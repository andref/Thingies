Thingies -- Little tools I use
==============================


## battery.sh ##

This is a script registered with Mac OS' `launchctl` that periodically
polls the state of the laptop battery and updates a CSV file with the
information.


## prices ##

Whenever I go grocery shopping, I get the receipt and input the prices
of whatever I bought using this tool and it feeds a JSON file with dates
and prices.

### To do ###

-   Generate a report after I'm done, telling me what was bought and if
    it was cheaper than average
